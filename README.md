## Dependency:
- **Python** (3.7)
- **wxPython** (4.0)
- **numPy** (1.15)
- **OpenCV** (4.1)
- **pySerial** (3.4)
(- **PyOpenAL**)

## Note
This software was used in 2016 to train/test common marmoset monkeys, 
using an arena equipped with three surrounding screens, three webcams to watch the frontal area of each screen, an automatic feeder[1], and 5.1 channel speakers also surrounding the arena.
It was coded to use the specific design of the arena, and its current state is not suitable for using it for other training/experiments as it is.
However, this is uploaded to a repository in 2020 for the purpose of sharing pieces of code with coleagues.
It will be updated when it's developed in more generalized and structured form.
